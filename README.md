## 🛤️ Moving to Production
These implementations are designed for 2026-scale workloads. To deploy:
1. **Distillation**: Use the Synthetic Data pipelines to transfer logic from Llama 3.2 to smaller models.
2. **Quantization**: Apply QAT or FP8 post-training quantization for edge suitability.
3. **Deployment**: Export to GGUF or vLLM for high-throughput serving.
